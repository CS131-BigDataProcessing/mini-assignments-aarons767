1) To find the words that started with "wor", we used the help of wildcards particularly the \w*
Character surrounding the substring "word". The \w* was added in order to let the terminal know
that we're gonna accept anything number of characters before "wor" and after "wor." Since we needed whole words we decided to use -o so we'd only print portions of the line instead of the whole line. 

2) We follow quite the similar logic to find words that contain "dred" as we did in question 1.

3) To find the phrase "Good luck, babe" I utilized the grep instruction. This helped get the entire line that contained the substring "Good luck, babe" and printed it out to the terminal. 

4) To find the line counts and word counts for the for Good luck, babe, we first saved the response into a temp file using > glTemp.txt. In this way, we'd now continue working on finding out the word count and the line counts of the text in this new output from question 3.

5) I used wc -l glTemp.txt > dsouzaa_a2_counts.txt to get the number of lines in the output and then 
wc -w glTemp.txt >> dsouzaa_a2_counts.txt to append the value of the number of words in the output into tthis current file. The number 6, as a result, represents the number of lines where "Good luck, babe" appears and 78 is the total number of words in the entire output in all lines.
