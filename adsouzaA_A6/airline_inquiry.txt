Question 1)
The airlines are as follows: American, Alaska, Jet Blue, Delta,
United, Soutwest. I used the awk -F, '{print $4}' airline_stats.csv
command to get this informatino. It basically helped print the fourth 
command separated item. 
Question 2)
A)The airlines that have a carrier delay greater than 10 are:
American Airlines, Alaska, Jet blue, Delta, United, Southwest.
We used the command: awk -F, '$1 > 10 {print $4}' aurline_stats.csv | sort
B)I used the following command to find airlines with a carrier delay greater
than the threshold of 15: awk -F, -v Threshold=15 '$1 > Threshold {print $4}' airline_stats.csv. The airlines are:American, Delta, United, JetBlue, Southwest, Alaska (in unordered state).
